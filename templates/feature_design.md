Notes:
**Pyramid Structure** (answer first):
1. The Decision - one clear sentence
2. Core Implementation - minimal working code
3. Supporting Context - why this approach
4. Patterns Discovered - what to remember

Template:
# Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]

## The Approach
[One sentence: what we're building and how]

## Core Implementation
```language
// Minimal code showing the key idea and how it satisfies the product requirements
```

[MermaidJS diagrams (Optional, only if appropriate)]

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Foundation]
```language
// Key code
```
**Verify:** [How to test this works]

### Step 2: [Core Logic]
```language
// Builds on step 1
```
**Verify:** [Test for this step]
**Rollback:** [If this fails]

### Step 3: [Integration]
```language
// Connect the pieces
```
**Verify:** [End-to-end test]

## Design Context

### Experiments
* **Tried:** [Approach A] → [Why it didn't work]
* **Chose:** [Approach B] → [Why it fits]

### Patterns Applied
* [Pattern from CLAUDE.md] → [How we used it]
