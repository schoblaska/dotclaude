## Bug Fix

Fixes configuration values not updating when users interact with input controls.

The settings UI coordinates three `input-control` instances and one `visualization-chart` through the parent `settings-manager` controller. Controllers communicate via [event dispatch](https://example.com/docs/event-coordination): input changes trigger `value-changed` events to the parent, which broadcasts `set-value` events to sibling inputs and `config-updated` to refresh the chart.

The root cause: events weren't properly routed between controllers. Fixed by explicitly mapping events as `event->trigger` pairs in controller actions.

## Major Feature

Implements machine-to-machine authentication for API endpoints using [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AuthProvider
    participant API
    participant TokenVerifier

    Note over Client,AuthProvider: Client Credentials Flow

    Client->>AuthProvider: POST /oauth2/token
    Note right of Client: ID: API_CLIENT_ID<br/>Secret: API_CLIENT_SECRET<br/>Scope: target-entity:{API_ENTITY_ID}:read

    AuthProvider-->>Client: JWT

    Client->>API: API Request with JWT Bearer Token

    API->>TokenVerifier: Verify JWT
        Note left of TokenVerifier: Validates:<br/>1. RS256 Signature<br/>2. Audience matches API_ENTITY_ID<br/>3. Token expiration<br/>4. Required claims (sub, permissions)<br/>5. Has 'read' permission

    TokenVerifier->>AuthProvider: GET /.well-known/jwks.json
    Note left of TokenVerifier: Fetch public key matching<br/>token's 'kid' claim
    AuthProvider-->>TokenVerifier: JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)

    alt Token Valid
        TokenVerifier-->>API: Token verified
        API-->>Client: 200 Success Response
    else Token Invalid
        TokenVerifier-->>API: Validation Failed
        API-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

### Key Changes

* Clarified ENV variable names and injected `.env` into Docker Compose auth container for configuration script access
* Added manual JWKS setup for testsâ€”enables different test scenarios while maintaining JWT verification on every request

### Local Setup

Rebuild your auth instance:

```
docker-compose down -v
bin/setup
```

Or preserve your dev database:

```
docker-compose down -v auth
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS authdb;"
bin/setup
```

### apicurl Helper

New script handles auth flow using `.env` values for local development:

```
bin/apicurl http://localhost:3000/api/resources/123
```

### Next Steps

* Link organization/web login with entity client credentials; expose client ID and secret in web UI
* Document auth flow, token expiry, and credential acquisition
* Create script for provisioning new customer organizations/users/entities

## Code Refactor

Simplifies query extension with additional filters (without mutation), following ActiveRecord's relation pattern.

### Changes

* **Removed `MetricsCounts` concern** â€“ Logic now lives directly in the component rather than requiring controllers to mix in and call helpers
* **Removed `QueryTerms`** â€“ Term normalization moved to `Query::Parser`; consumers now interact with query objects instead of raw strings
* **Relocated link construction** â€“ UI element links now built in view components where they belong
* **Separated parser responsibilities** â€“ `Query#filters` returns all parsed filters; parser focuses solely on parsing
* **Added `Query#exclude`** â€“ Inverse of `Query#where` for removing filters
* **Extracted stats bar partial** â€“ Split from results partial for better rendering control
* **Added ViewComponent test** â€“ Components localize UI logic and markup for higher cohesion than helper/concern coordination. [Testing is straightforward](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/testing.html) since components are plain objects.

### Technical Note

Avoid instance variables in partialsâ€”they couple partials to specific controller contexts. Top-level views can use ivars (they're inherently coupled to controller actions), but partials should receive explicit locals for modularity.

### What's Next

Future PRs will continue leveraging query objects for simplification. I'm discovering the domain model by examining what abstractions other code needs from queries and identifying natural responsibility boundaries.

Since querying and filtering are fundamental to both web and API, building a robust model here reduces complexity throughout the codebase. (Please rein me in if the abstractions get too elaborate ðŸ˜‚)
