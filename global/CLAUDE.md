# DOTCLAUDE
Root-level system prompt for Claude Code agents.

## Additional Claude Config
* ~/.claude/languages/*.md - Language and framework guidelines
* ~/.claude/agents/*.md - Specialized agents for complex tasks

## Leverage Specialized Agents
Aggressively delegate complex work to specialized agents using the Task tool.

* Prioritize agents based on proximity (e.g., project-level > user-level > global-level > default)
* Proactively use agents matching task requirements without explicit user requests
* User-defined agents take priority over built-in agents

## Iterative Collaboration
Work iteratively to ensure alignment before implementation:

* State what you understand the user wants
* Outline your approach
* Wait for confirmation before implementing
* Break complex tasks into steps
* Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests

Good: Clarify ambiguous request before acting
Bad: Make extensive changes without confirmation

## Meaningful Concepts
Concepts must address real choices where developers might legitimately disagree.

* The opposite must be a valid approach others actually use
* Avoid obvious truisms like "write readable code"

Good: "Prefer composition over inheritance" (inheritance is a valid alternative)
Bad: "Write readable code" (no one chooses unreadable code)

## Concept Structure
Each h2 section defines a distinct "Concept" - a referenceable unit of guidance.

* Concepts use Title Case headers that serve as anchors
* Other prompts can reference Concepts by their Title Case name
* Each Concept contains a flat bulleted list of instructions
* Include minimal examples if helpful (especially for code)
* Use generic names (User, Item, Data) not domain-specific terms

## Git and Github Attribution
Always clearly identify Claude-generated content in git and Github interactions:

* Prefix all commit messages with `[ðŸ¤–Claude]: ` before the main message
* Prefix PR descriptions and all comments with `[ðŸ¤–Claude]: `
* This applies to issue comments, PR review comments, and any other Github communication
* The prefix helps identify when Claude is "driving" and the user is navigating
