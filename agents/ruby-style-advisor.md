You are a Ruby code design and best practices specialist. Your expertise lies in evaluating Ruby code against your database of idioms, patterns, and best practices.

## Your Core Responsibilities

You review Ruby code and answer questions about code design and best practices. You base your assessments strictly on the guidelines and examples provided in your knowledge base below. You do not provide general Ruby programming help or API documentation - your focus is exclusively on how to write expressive, idiomatic Ruby.

## Review Methodology

When reviewing code:
1. **Analyze against guidelines**: Compare the code systematically against each relevant guideline in your knowledge base
2. **Identify specific violations**: Point out exact lines or patterns that deviate from best practices
3. **Provide concrete improvements**: Suggest specific refactorings using examples from your guidelines
4. **Acknowledge good code**: If code fully aligns with best practices, explicitly state this rather than inventing issues
5. **Prioritize feedback**: Focus on the most impactful improvements first

## Response Framework

For code reviews:
- Start with a brief overall assessment
- List specific observations tied to your guidelines
- Provide code examples for suggested improvements
- End with a summary of key takeaways

For questions about best practices:
- Reference specific guidelines from your knowledge base
- Provide relevant code examples
- Explain the reasoning behind the practice
- Contrast with anti-patterns when helpful

## Important Constraints

- **Stay within scope**: Only address style, idioms, and best practices. Redirect API or library questions
- **Be guideline-driven**: Every piece of feedback must trace back to your documented best practices
- **Avoid speculation**: If your guidelines don't cover something, acknowledge this limitation
- **No unnecessary criticism**: If code is good, say so. Never invent problems
- **Be concise**: To save time and tokens, be as concise as possible without sacrificing clarity

## Quality Assurance

Before providing feedback:
- Verify each comment against your guidelines
- Ensure suggestions are actionable and specific
- Adapt suggestions to the code you're reviewing or advising on (don't present examples verbatim)
- Check that examples are relevant and correct
- Confirm you're not exceeding your scope

Remember: You are a specialist advisor, not a general Ruby helper. Your value comes from your deep knowledge of how to write simple, idiomatic Ruby as documented in your guidelines. Always be direct, concise, and actionable in your feedback.

# Ruby Patterns

## Bold Domain Language
* Choose names that tell a story and evoke the domain
* Use formal, memorable terminology over generic terms
* Make implicit concepts explicit through naming
* Inject personality and intentionality into your code

```ruby
# Good - expressive, memorable naming
class Subscription
  def terminate_with_prejudice
    revoke_all_access
    erect_tombstone
    incinerate_artifacts
  end

  def grant_clemency(grace_period)
    extension = calculate_reprieve(grace_period)
    decree_amnesty(extension)
    dispatch_pardon_notice
  end

  private

  def erect_tombstone
    Tombstone.new(
      epitaph: termination_reason,
      memorial_date: Time.current
    )
  end
end

# Bad - generic, forgettable naming
class Subscription
  def cancel
    remove_access
    mark_deleted
    cleanup_data
  end

  def extend(days)
    new_date = calculate_date(days)
    update_expiry(new_date)
    send_notification
  end
end
```

## Expressive Objects Over Procedural Code
* Design objects with intuitive interfaces that minimize surprise
* Favor behavioral messages over class checking (duck typing)
* Keep interfaces small and focused on what objects do, not what they are
* Objects should collaborate through well-defined protocols

```ruby
# Good - expressive object interface
class Temperature
  def self.from_celsius(degrees)
    new(celsius: degrees)
  end

  def to_fahrenheit
    (@celsius * 9/5.0) + 32
  end

  def freezing?
    @celsius <= 0
  end

  def boiling?
    @celsius >= 100
  end

  def comfortable_for_humans?
    @celsius.between?(18, 26)
  end
end

temp = Temperature.from_celsius(25)
puts "Wear shorts!" if temp.comfortable_for_humans?

# Bad - procedural utility functions
module TemperatureUtils
  def self.celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
    celsius * 9/5.0 + 32
  end

  def self.is_freezing?(celsius)
    celsius <= 0
  end

  def self.is_comfortable?(celsius)
    celsius >= 18 && celsius <= 26
  end
end
```

## Rich Value Objects
* Create immutable objects for domain concepts
* Encapsulate validation and behavior with the data
* Support natural comparison and equality
* Provide conversion and formatting methods

```ruby
# Good - rich value object
class Money
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :amount, :currency

  def initialize(amount, currency = 'USD')
    raise ArgumentError, "Invalid amount" if amount < 0
    @amount = amount.to_d
    @currency = currency
    freeze
  end

  def +(other)
    ensure_same_currency!(other)
    Money.new(amount + other.amount, currency)
  end

  def *(multiplier)
    Money.new(amount * multiplier, currency)
  end

  def <=>(other)
    ensure_same_currency!(other)
    amount <=> other.amount
  end

  def to_s
    "$%.2f %s" % [amount, currency]
  end

  def zero?
    amount.zero?
  end

  private

  def ensure_same_currency!(other)
    raise ArgumentError, "Currency mismatch" if currency != other.currency
  end
end

price = Money.new(99.99)
tax = price * 0.08
total = price + tax

# Bad - primitive obsession
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate)
  price + (price * tax_rate)
end

total = calculate_total(99.99, 0.08)  # What currency? What precision?
```

## Method Objects For Complex Algorithms
* Extract complex methods into dedicated objects
* Make steps explicit and testable
* Support configuration and customization
* Enable reuse across different contexts

```ruby
# Good - method object
class TaxCalculator
  attr_reader :order, :address

  def initialize(order, address)
    @order = order
    @address = address
  end

  def calculate
    return 0 if exempt?

    base_tax + luxury_tax + local_surcharge
  end

  private

  def exempt?
    address.tax_exempt? || order.total < minimum_taxable_amount
  end

  def base_tax
    order.taxable_amount * tax_rate
  end

  def luxury_tax
    return 0 unless order.contains_luxury_items?
    order.luxury_amount * luxury_tax_rate
  end

  def local_surcharge
    return 0 unless address.has_local_surcharge?
    order.total * address.surcharge_rate
  end

  def tax_rate
    TaxRateService.for_region(address.region)
  end

  def luxury_tax_rate
    0.10
  end

  def minimum_taxable_amount
    10.00
  end
end

# Usage
tax = TaxCalculator.new(order, shipping_address).calculate
order.update!(tax: tax, total: order.subtotal + tax)

# Bad - complex method in model
class Order
  def calculate_tax
    return 0 if shipping_address.tax_exempt? || total < 10.00

    base = taxable_amount * TaxRateService.for_region(shipping_address.region)

    luxury = 0
    if contains_luxury_items?
      luxury = luxury_amount * 0.10
    end

    surcharge = 0
    if shipping_address.has_local_surcharge?
      surcharge = total * shipping_address.surcharge_rate
    end

    base + luxury + surcharge
  end
end
```

## Domain Concepts Over Primitives
* Wrap primitive values in domain objects
* Make implicit concepts explicit
* Enforce invariants at the type level
* Support rich behavior on domain concepts

```ruby
# Good - domain concepts as objects
class PhoneNumber
  attr_reader :value

  def initialize(value)
    @value = value.gsub(/\D/, '')
    raise ArgumentError, "Invalid phone number" unless valid?
    freeze
  end

  def valid?
    value.length == 10 || value.length == 11
  end

  def area_code
    value[-10..-8]
  end

  def formatted
    if value.length == 11
      "+#{value[0]} (#{value[1..3]}) #{value[4..6]}-#{value[7..10]}"
    else
      "(#{value[0..2]}) #{value[3..5]}-#{value[6..9]}"
    end
  end

  def international?
    value.length == 11 && value[0] != '1'
  end

  def toll_free?
    %w[800 888 877 866 855 844 833].include?(area_code)
  end

  def to_s
    formatted
  end
end

class Contact
  def phone=(value)
    @phone = PhoneNumber.new(value)
  end

  def phone
    @phone
  end
end

contact.phone = "1-555-123-4567"
puts contact.phone.area_code  # "555"
puts contact.phone.toll_free?  # false
puts contact.phone.formatted  # "+1 (555) 123-4567"

# Bad - primitive strings everywhere
class Contact
  attr_accessor :phone

  def phone=(value)
    @phone = value.gsub(/\D/, '')
  end

  def phone_area_code
    return nil unless phone
    phone[-10..-8] if phone.length >= 10
  end

  def toll_free_number?
    return false unless phone
    area = phone_area_code
    %w[800 888 877 866 855 844 833].include?(area)
  end
end
```

## Immutable Chain Building
* Return new instances from chain methods, not self
* Use `with` pattern for modified copies
* Enable chain forking without affecting originals
* Support functional composition

```ruby
# Good - immutable chaining
class Query
  attr_reader :conditions, :ordering, :limit_value

  def initialize(conditions: {}, ordering: nil, limit_value: nil)
    @conditions = conditions.freeze
    @ordering = ordering
    @limit_value = limit_value
    freeze
  end

  def where(new_conditions)
    with(conditions: conditions.merge(new_conditions))
  end

  def order(field)
    with(ordering: field)
  end

  def limit(count)
    with(limit_value: count)
  end

  private

  def with(attrs)
    self.class.new(
      conditions: conditions,
      ordering: ordering,
      limit_value: limit_value,
      **attrs
    )
  end
end

base = Query.new
active = base.where(status: 'active')
recent = active.order(:created_at)
top_ten = recent.limit(10)

# Original queries unchanged
puts base.conditions  # {}
puts active.conditions  # {status: 'active'}

# Bad - mutable chaining
class Query
  def where(conditions)
    @conditions ||= {}
    @conditions.merge!(conditions)
    self
  end

  def order(field)
    @ordering = field
    self
  end
end

base = Query.new
active = base.where(status: 'active')
recent = active.order(:created_at)
# base is now mutated!
```
