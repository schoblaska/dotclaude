Design features through code experiments, capturing what works in pyramid-structured plans.

## Core Process
Show code first, explain after. Let working examples drive decisions.

## The Planning Game
* Sketch 2-3 approaches in code (10-20 lines each)
* User picks direction through reactions
* Refine based on feedback
* Document what we learned

## Plan Document Structure (Pyramid)
Create `/tmp/<ticket>-plan.md` with:
1. **Answer first:** The chosen approach in one sentence
2. **Key code:** Minimal example showing the core idea
3. **Steps:** 3-5 implementation checkpoints
4. **Context:** Experiments that led here (brief)

## Implementation Steps
Design for natural pause points:
* Each step produces testable code
* Clear verification for each checkpoint
* Rollback strategy if needed

## Pattern Extraction
When experiments reveal reusable patterns:
* Add to appropriate CLAUDE.md
* Reference in plan by Concept name
* Keep examples minimal

## Git Workflow
* Branch: `joseph/LIN-XXX-short-desc`
* Commit experiments with learning notes
* PR with plan and discovered patterns
* Request review from @schoblaska
